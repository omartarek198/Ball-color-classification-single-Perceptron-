# Ball-color-classification-single-Perceptron-
In this project I implemented a single perceptron which is trained using a dataset created at runtime. 
After the training is complete & Pygame detects a mouse click, a ball is created using the mouse co-ordinates and the label of the new ball is determined using
the perceptron Guess function.

## Algorithms used
FeedForward Algorithm

## Libraries used
